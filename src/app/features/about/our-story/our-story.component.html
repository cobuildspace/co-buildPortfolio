        <p class="story-paragraph">
          CoBuild was born from a simple observation: too many Angular projects were struggling with broken code, outdated versions, and developers who delivered without truly understanding the problems. We saw companies stuck with legacy code, performance issues, and features that didn't work as expected.
        </p>
        <p class="story-paragraph">
          That's when we decided to do things differently. We founded CoBuild on the principle of true collaboration - we're not just developers for hire, we're partners in your project's success. Our team specializes exclusively in Angular, giving us deep expertise in everything from routing and error resolution to component architecture and performance optimization.
        </p>

          Today, we work with startups, mid-size companies, and enterprises across healthcare, finance, education, and e-commerce. Our approach remains the same: build together, solve real problems, and deliver results that make a difference.
